First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to God for everything. I am deeply passionate about technology and entrepreneurship, especially in building tech-based businesses. I have experience in various fields including digital marketing, electrical engineering, robotics programming, image processing, value investing, business management, and leadership.

I enjoy the journey, embracing both successes and failures as they come. I am committed and thorough in my work. When I set a target or goal, I approach it with responsibility, focus, and determination, not easily giving up. Receiving a role or mandate is an honor for me, and I strive to fulfill it sincerely and to the best of my ability. Ultimately, I believe that attitude is paramount in all aspects of life.

Professional Profile
======
Iâ€™m a roboticist, autonomous navigation developer and researcher in mobile robotics who is proficient at examining
navigation systems and controlling mobile robot using SLAM and Deep Reinforcement Learning.I have finished my master's at
Gadjah Mada University Indonesia. As an engineering student, I have specialized skills in robotics software development and AI
for robotics (DQN) and during my career time, 

I have developed professional skills and competencies in Python/C++, robotics programming(ROS), RVIZ2, Matlab, Scilab,Tensorflow,Stable-baseline3,OpenAI-gym,Pybullet Sim and Gazebo Sim.My typical
workflow consists of (but not limited to) mapping, sensor fusion,path planning using A*, 3D visualization and AI modelling.
Additionally, in the last two years, I have been focusing my interest on DQN and worked on projects such as Reward Shaping for
Robotics Navigation using DQN,Mecanum-Wheeled Robot Control Based on DRL, and AI-Based AgriBots: Towards Food
Sovereignty 4.0 with Artificial Intelligence-Based Robotics Systems. Moreover, I was also a co-founder of a company named PT
Robotik Academy Indonesia where I have been exposed to various industries for robotics projects/consultants and educational
service companies(i.e school projects and university classes).

Early and accurate detection of endemic bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium, is an important key in controlling
and treating endemic diseases. With advances in technology, the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as
a very effective tool in automatically detecting endemic bacteria. This research develops an automated endemic detection system that
integrates AI and IoT to identify endemic bacteria from patient samples with high accuracy and time efficiency. The system consists of two
main components: an innovative IoT sample collection device and an advanced AI model. IoT devices are designed to non-invasively and
autonomously collect samples (e.g. sputum) directly from the patient, which are then sent wirelessly to the laboratory for further analysis.
The AI model, drilled with thousands of microscopic images of endemic bacteria, uses Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) techniques to identify the presence of endemic bacteria with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. This research aims to have an
automatic endemic bacteria detection system capable of identifying endemic bacteria with an accuracy of more than 80%, significantly
reducing the time required for diagnosis compared to conventional methods. This system not only increases diagnostic efficiency but also
allows the detection of endemic bacteria to be mapped via IoT connectivity. It is hoped that the implementation of this system can speed up
the process of detecting endemic bacteria, enable faster and more effective medical intervention, and reduce the spread of disease. Further
research will focus on improving the accuracy of AI models, miniaturizing IoT automated microscope devices, and developing more efficient
algorithms for large-scale data processing.

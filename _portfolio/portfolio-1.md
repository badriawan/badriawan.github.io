    The urgency of using robotics in agriculture lies in the need to increase efficiency, productivity and user friendliness in agricultural
processes. The existence of intelligent robotics and lighting systems based on artificial intelligence is expected to reduce dependence on
human work energy, reduce the risk of human error, and increase accuracy and speed in agricultural processes which also supports the
government's efforts towards monitoring Indonesian food.The research under this research umbrella aims to integrate artificial intelligence
(AI), especially deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Large Language Models (LLM) into robotics for various agricultural applications. This
research aims to develop various robotics algorithms that are capable of carrying out certain tasks that are useful in the agricultural sector.
AI is used to recognize the environment (perception), navigate, or understand and respond to verbal instructions from users intuitively.
Through LLM, robots can recognize context, understand human language, and make intelligent decisions. Examples of applications are in
automatic excavator robots or automatic arm robots which are used to pick up certain objects such as harvested fruit and placed in a truck
for transport, growing robots (growing robots) which are used to get into narrow and hard-to-reach areas to facilitate the process. planting
seeds, to wheeled robots for moving crops. The intended output of this research is four articles published in international conference
proceedings indexed by SCOPUS.
